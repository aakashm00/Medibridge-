SignSpeak AI – Real-Time Sign Language Translator for Inclusive Communication
📄 Project Summary

SignSpeak AI is an AI-powered web application that enables real-time translation of sign language into text and speech. Designed to assist people with hearing or speech disabilities, the system uses a webcam and computer vision to capture hand gestures and facial expressions, interprets them with machine learning models, and outputs readable text and spoken words. This bridges the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers in everyday interactions.

🌟 Core Features

📷 Real-time Camera Access: Capture sign language gestures using a webcam.

🧠 AI-powered Recognition: Machine learning models interpret hand gestures and facial expressions.

📝 Text Transcript Generation: Converts recognized gestures into readable text.

🔊 Text-to-Speech Output: Speech synthesis with adjustable voice and speed for accessibility.

♿ Accessible Interface: High-contrast mode, large fonts, and clear visual indicators for usability.

💬 Conversation History: Track recognized gestures and spoken text in a conversation log.

✅ Gesture Confidence Scoring: Provides feedback on recognition accuracy.

🧪 Hackathon Evaluation Criteria
Impact

Solves a real-world communication barrier for people with hearing or speech disabilities.

Enables independent interaction in public spaces, workplaces, and social settings.

Helps non-signers understand sign language without prior training.

Execution

Novelty: Combines real-time computer vision, accessibility-first design, and speech synthesis in a single web platform.

Implementation: Modular architecture for scalable development; gesture confidence scoring ensures accurate recognition.

Collaboration

Clear role division ensures expertise focus.

Regular check-ins, shared documentation, and collaborative tools (GitHub, Figma, Trello) enabled smooth coordination.

Sustainability

Scalable and adaptable:

Extendable to multiple sign languages (e.g., ASL, Auslan)

Open-source potential for community contributions

Integrates with public service kiosks, educational platforms, or mobile apps

Presentation

Clear problem statement and solution

Visual mockups and demo (if available)

Real-world use cases and user stories

Technical architecture and roadmap

🛠️ Tech Stack
